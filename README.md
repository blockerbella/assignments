## V School Projects and Assignments

These are the projects & assignments assigned by V School in Salt Lake City Utah. V School students learn the MERN stack while attending. Some specifics:

    - Javascript (DOM, JSON, CRUD apps, ES6, debugging)
    - HTML and CSS
    - Unit Testing
    - React (ReactDOM, lifecycle methods, dynamic styling and rendering, higher-order components)
    - MongoDB (schemas, CRUD, and deployment)

Projects and assignments included in this repositiory is as follows:
    
    - Moms-shopping-list-start: the primary purpose of this project is to show competency interacting with the html DOM. While     React makes it easier to interact with changes to the DOM, in V School we first learned how to directly interact with it before moving to React.
    - Flags: purely for css practice.
    - Pokemon: the purpose of this project is to use vanilla Javascript to interact with JSON. 
    - Bountyhunters: the purpose of this project is to use Express.js to create an API. Students used Postman to interact with     the API before creating an interface. Demonstration of GET, POST, DELETE and PUT was also used in this project. 
    - Axios todo: the purpose of this assignment was to create a todo list using React for the UI and axios to interact with       an API hosted with V School. 
    -Daily planet editor: a debugging project, cloned from the VSchool github repo.
    -Colossaladventure: goal of this assignment was to use Node.js in order to create a game. Students must have random enemies     appear that also deal damage, option to run and attack. Was probably my favorite project.
    -Reactbusinesshome: a simple react App to demonstrate competency of basic react components such as navbars, footers, lists     and images.
