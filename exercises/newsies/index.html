    <header><u>Salt Lake Has No Snow in 500 years!</u></header>
    <div class="box-container">

        <div class='box one'>
                For over 500 years, Salt Lake City has not had 1 inch of snow. The last inch was recorded in year 2503 
                after Yellowstone blew. As we know it, it has lately been like the weather of the <b>tropical paradise of Florida</b>. In Florida, everyone is happy, no one does crime,
                and there is no such thing as hate. The weather Gods realized that no one likes amazing 
                sports like sledding, snowboarding or snowmobiling. <u>Everyone</u> is able to walk around in bikinis
                and swim trunks. Just be careful to use sunscreen and shades. You must also be aware of the Florida man. If you are not
                aware of what Florida man is, please explain to me what you do in your free time? Because you clearly aren't on Reddit. 
                If you don't know what Florida man is, please go look it up.

                So this a repeat of the other, since I'm not sure what else to type.For over 500 years, Salt Lake City has not had 1 inch of snow. The last inch was recorded in year 2503 
                after Yellowstone blew. As we know it, it has lately been like the weather of the <b>tropical paradise of Florida</b>. In Florida, everyone is happy, no one does crime,
